                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>I come from little, cute village in the west part of Poland. I love
                    pure nature - old forests, big, clear lakes. Now I'm living in a huge
                    city, I came here to find my career path. <br />First I've been worked
                    in a custommer service, merchandising, through accounting office, art
                    shop, e-commerce. Most of the time I spend in a petrol businnes. It
                    wasn't dream work but I loved this place because of people with who
                    I've been almost every day. Finally I managed the petrol station. I
                    was doing various tasks, resolving many issues (both easy and
                    difficult) and I was proud from my crew's achievements. But it was
                    unfortunately the end of my path in that place. I've been thinking a
                    long time what I should do to improve myself. I had a couple of ideas,
                    so I decided to make both happen.<br />...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, now I'm a mummy who learns everything what is curious for me.
                    <br />First I started learn english from scratch (now it's B2
                    according to test results), remind German words and grammar (Hier ist
                    es ein bisschen schwieriger aber ich lerne immer noch ausdauernd.).<br />
                    I started to read about Frontend and saw how extensive it is. I read
                    deeper and deeper and created that page in Vue. Actually I still
                    create, because I still learn new things.<br />Now my kid attends
                    kindergarten consequently I can look for a job, but now something what
                    will have a long career way, so that in the future I won't have to
                    give up a job that I might love.
